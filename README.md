## TODO

- [ ] This
	- [ ] script that parses all output locations and removes any dead symlinks
	- [ ] allow optional script field in modules.json that will 'enable' the config when linked or something (e.g. recompile xmonad, enable/start services, source bashrc, etc.)
- [ ] Polybar
	- [ ] colors!
	- [ ] better/different icon fonts
	- [ ] better play-pause/media controls and spacing and stuff (remove python dependency)
- [ ] XMonad
	- [ ] remove dependence on "default" config so that everything is in my config and nothing more or less
	- [ ] make new terminals grab focus when created
	- [ ] default programs (e.g. firefox on 1, spotify + discord + slack on 2, lightscreen + zoom + other bg utils)
	- [ ] switch to main workspace on startup
	- [ ] workspace settings (workspace icons, always keep firefox on left in workspace 1)
	- [ ] allow tabbed windows on any workspace
	- [ ] better way of showing selected window (blue or green bottom tab border seems like a good idea when window is not only window on workspace)
	- [ ] disable mouse
	- [ ] allow pinning media between workspaces
	- [ ] figure out tabbed windows and maybe make the one-window layout put everything in tabs
	- [ ] force all zoom windows to be in one tabbed setup rather than mucking everything with a million windows
- [ ] Investigate launcher
	- [ ] ulauncher
	- [ ] rofi
- [ ] Investigate dunst
- [ ] Investigate PDF viewer
	- [ ] MuPDF
	- [ ] Zathura
- [ ] 'Finalize' fonts and colors (especially for terminal)
