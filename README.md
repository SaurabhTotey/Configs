## TODO

- [ ] Polybar
	- [ ] colors!
	- [ ] better/different icon fonts
	- [ ] better play-pause/media controls and spacing and stuff (remove python dependency)
- [ ] XMonad
	- [ ] default programs (e.g. firefox on 1, spotify + discord + slack on 2, lightscreen + zoom + other bg utils)
	- [ ] workspace settings (workspace icons, always keep firefox on left in workspace 1, use 3-column for workspace 2)
	- [ ] allow tabbed windows on any workspace
	- [ ] better way of showing selected window (blue or green bottom tab border seems like a good idea when window is not only window on workspace)
	- [ ] disable mouse
	- [ ] allow pinning media between workspaces
	- [ ] figure out tabbed windows and maybe make the one-window layout put everything in tabs
	- [ ] force all zoom windows to be in one tabbed setup rather than mucking everything with a million windows
- [ ] NVim
	- [ ] fix NVIM from thinking fragment shaders are filled with errors
- [ ] Investigate launcher
	- [ ] ulauncher
	- [ ] rofi
- [ ] Investigate dunst
- [ ] Investigate MuPDF as PDF viewer
- [ ] 'Finalize' fonts and colors (especially for terminal)
- [ ] Upload setup to Github (configs, programs, scripts, organization structure, etc)
